### Grocery Store

## Overview

The "Grocery Store" project is a modern web application designed using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and various UI and animation libraries. This project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for browsing grocery items, with a focus on a responsive design and smooth user experience.

## Design Decisions

### Technologies Used

1. **Next.js**: Chosen for its capabilities in server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), which enhances performance and SEO.
2. **Tailwind CSS**: Utilized for its utility-first approach to styling, allowing for rapid and customizable design.
3. **Radix UI**: Provides accessible and customizable UI components, such as dropdown menus, which enhance the user experience.
4. **Embla Carousel**: Used for creating responsive and accessible carousels, ensuring smooth transitions and interactions.
5. **Lottie**: Integrates animation with Lottie files for a more engaging visual experience.

### Design and Layout

- **Container**: The layout is centered with padding and responsive sizing using Tailwind's container utility.
- **Colors and Styles**: A custom color palette is defined using CSS variables, ensuring a cohesive look and feel.
- **Animations**: Keyframe animations are utilized for accordion components, enhancing the interactive experience.
